This app's purpose is to helping you keep track of your music.

The app can be build with Android Studio.
Please enter you Discogs API key in AddMusicActivity.java file.

These are the some technologies i used and learned

-Room Database
-RecyclerView
-Rest API
-Volley and Picasso Libraries

Some features to add in future:

-Sorting

-Settings page

-Refreshing the main activity after deleting a music.

-Another Cover art provider (e.g. Spotify's API, mostly because discogs doesn't always return a great cover art.)
